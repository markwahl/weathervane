## The Weathervane Website

This project displays current weather information and forecasts for a user's location and/or a submitted address value, and prioritizes minimizing file download size and load time. The majority of the interactive elements are driven by CSS alone. Data is obtained from a number of open data API sources, parsed on the server-side in PHP, and rendered as HTML.

## Installation

1. Copy the files into a web-accessible directory.
2. Access in a browser.

Note: This web app attempts to use the IP address of a given user's connection to identify location. When working in a local dev environment, the geolocator locator is liable not to work well with a local IP address. You can add a known public IP address as a fallback to use under these circumstances.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6
* Access to the internet (none of the data will be available otherwise)
